#### Trading bot triplets

Team Dampier's entry for the 2016 eth1-sydney hackathon by Jane Street.

Sorbet is a set of three trading bots built for medium-frequency trading in a virtual market. They are:

1. BulbasaurBot - an attempted higher-frequency strategy
2. CaterpieBot - a standard buy-low-sell-high approach to trading with configurable risk settings
3. PikachuBot - uses a fair-price determination method to guide decision making
